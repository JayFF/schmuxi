# Schmuxi
A neat piece of software, designed to help evaluating experimental data.

At the moment, it solely focusses on optical and spectroscopic measurements and is supposed to automate plotting, publishing and creating reports for your labbook. When it is fully functional it should also be fully configurable for other experimental data and you will be able to integrate the packages in your own projects.

# Install
